    <h3>Remote Work Scenario – Inside the Lobby</h3>

    <p class="quote">
      The journey of transformation does not begin with the question: What will you do?<br>
      But with a deeper one:<br>
      <strong>Who do you want to become?</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      This is where the role of the Lobby Manager begins,
      working with you to understand and build:
    </p>

    <ul class="tbc-list">
      <li>Your personal and professional vision</li>
      <li>The field in which you want to own your own company</li>
      <li>The product or service you are passionate about offering</li>
      <li>Your sales and deal objectives</li>
      <li>The markets and countries you aim to expand into</li>
      <li>The size of the team you want to build</li>

    <h3>Phase One: The TBC POINTS Index</h3>

    <p>
      Capital is converted into a smart operational index called:
    </p>

    <div class="badge">TBC POINTS</div>

    <p>
      This is the financial value indicator
      through which the capital injected by TBC Business Club
      to activate your company is measured
      in a professional, calculated, and efficient manner.
    </p>

    <ul class="tbc-list">
      <li><strong>Every $10,000 = 1 TBC Point</strong></li>
      <li>The first Point is activated immediately after:
        <ul>
          <li>Company formation</li>
          <li>Subscription activation</li>
          <li>Granting you access to your personal dashboard</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="note">
      The capital belongs exclusively to your company
      and is managed through the lobby
      to ensure proper utilization
      until financial cash flow is achieved.
